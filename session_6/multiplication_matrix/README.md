# Matrix Multiplication

This program demonstrates matrix multiplication between two 5x5 matrices.

## Matrix A

```
[10, 7, 9, 6, 5]
[1, 3, 2, 4, 9]
[7, 5, 8, 6, 2]
[2, 1, 9, 3, 4]
[3, 10, 1, 7, 8]
```

## Matrix B

```
[8, 2, 1, 9, 3]
[4, 6, 7, 3, 5]
[9, 2, 3, 8, 1]
[1, 2, 4, 5, 7]
[3, 6, 2, 1, 8]
```

## Result of Matrix Multiplication (A Ã— B)

```
[210, 122, 120, 218, 156]
[69, 86, 62, 63, 120]    
[160, 84, 94, 174, 112]  
[116, 58, 56, 112, 73]   
[104, 130, 120, 108, 173]
```

The result was calculated using the standard matrix multiplication algorithm where each element in the result matrix is the dot product of a row from Matrix A and a column from Matrix B.
